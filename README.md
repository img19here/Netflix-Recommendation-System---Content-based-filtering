# Netflix-Recommendation-System---Content-based-filtering
**Netflix Recommendation System using AI/ML**

**Project Overview**

This project implements a recommendation system for Netflix using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. The system predicts user preferences for movies  based on content based filtering.

**Features**

Content-Based Filtering: The system also considers movie/TV show features such as genre, cast, director, etc., for personalized recommendations.

**Technologies Used**

- <ins>Programming Language</ins>: Python

- <ins>Libraries/Frameworks</ins>:

- <ins>Pandas</ins> for data manipulation

- <ins>NumPy</ins> for numerical operations

- <ins>Scikit</ins>-learn for machine learning models

- <ins>Streamlit</ins> (for creating a web-based interface)

- <ins>nltk</ins> for Natural Langyage Processing

**Data Source**: [Kaggle]

**Future Improvements**

- <ins>Deep Learning Models</ins>: Integrate neural networks for more advanced recommendations.

- <ins>Real-Time Recommendations</ins>: Implement real-time prediction updates based on user interaction.
